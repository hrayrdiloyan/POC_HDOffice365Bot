# POC_HDOffice365Bot
Small POC project using MS bot framework and Cognitive Services.
It creates a bot for email channel, which grabs attachment of incoming email to dedicated email address (used by bot). 
Content of attachment is sent to MS Cognitive Services for key phrase extractions which then is replied back to the user.

Update web config file with required keys for bot framework and for MS Cognitive Services.
